# ⚽ Premier League & Championship Data Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores trends in English football using datasets from the **Premier League** and the **Championship**.  
The goal is to answer specific questions about scoring patterns, disciplinary actions, and offensive productivity using **Python**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **scikit-learn**.  

This is a **work in progress** project — so far, we have completed the first part of the analysis on **average goals per match by season**. The next steps will cover disciplinary actions, shots vs goals, and team-level offensive performance.

## 🗂 Dataset  
The data comes from [Kaggle: English Premier League and Championship Full Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/panaaaaa/english-premier-league-and-championship-full-dataset).  

It contains match-level information such as:  
- Match date  
- Home and away teams  
- Goals scored (home and away)  
- Shots, fouls, yellow/red cards  
- Season and competition type

## ❓ Research Questions  
1. **How have average goals per match changed across seasons in the Premier League compared to the Championship?** ✅ *(completed)*  
2. Do disciplinary actions (yellow/red cards) show any noticeable trend over time?  
3. What is the relationship between shots taken and goals scored — does more shooting always mean more scoring?  
4. Which teams historically stand out as the most offensively productive (most goals per match)?

## 📊 Current Progress  

### 1. Average Goals Per Match by Season  
We calculated average goals per game for each season in both leagues and plotted the results.  

**Key Insight:**  
- The **Premier League** shows a clear upward trend in recent years, surpassing **3 goals per match** in the latest seasons.  
- The **Championship** remains more stable, usually between **2.4–2.7 goals per match**, reflecting a more defensive style.
