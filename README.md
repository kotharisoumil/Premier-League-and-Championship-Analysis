⚽ Premier League & Championship Data Analysis
📌 Overview

This project analyzes trends in English football using datasets from the Premier League and the Championship.
We explore scoring patterns, disciplinary actions, shot efficiency, and team-level offensive performance using Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

📊 Key Insights

Goals: The Premier League shows a steady upward trend, surpassing 3 goals per game in recent seasons. The Championship remains stable (≈2.4–2.7 goals/match).

Disciplinary Actions: Yellow and red cards show cyclical trends, with recent seasons trending slightly lower.

Shots vs Goals: More shots generally increase scoring likelihood, but efficiency varies greatly between teams.

Top Offenses: Certain Premier League clubs (e.g., Manchester City, Liverpool) dominate in goals per match, while top Championship sides vary season by season.
